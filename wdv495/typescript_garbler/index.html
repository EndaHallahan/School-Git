		<h1>Text Garbler</h1>
		<h4>Goal: create an effect that looks like a piece of text is being rapidly deciphered from an "encrypted" (garbled) string. Make it interactable through click or hover.</h4>
		<hr>

		<p>Attempt number three eschews random indexes in favor of a random <i>order</i>. It creates an array 0..n-1 where n is the length of the input string. This array is then shuffled using the Knuth algorithm. On each animation frame, the text is re-garbled, and then the last element in the array is removed and the corresponding index in the string is fixed. This removes the need for a maximum time duration.</p>
